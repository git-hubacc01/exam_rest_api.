# exam_rest_api.

A pleasant morning/afternoon/evening sir!❤️

Note: 

This is for Index.js and .gitingnore

Notice!⚠️

I made 4 repositories to each folder 
in my rest api. The following repositories 
includes:

exam_rest_api-controllers-
exam_rest_api-middleware-
exam_rest_api-models-
exam_rest_api-routes-

I made this 4 repositories because i cannot
upload using my git bash. These 4 can be 
found in my account's repository. Hoping for 
your kind consideration. Thank you and GodBless!❤️
